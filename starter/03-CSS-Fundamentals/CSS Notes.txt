Conflicst between selectors

 Selector Precedence:
 !Important - Will be last resort for confilicting styles it will win
 1. ID (#)
 2. Class (.)
 3. element with Pseudo Class(:first-child,...)
 4. elements (p,div,li)
 5. Universal Selctot(*)

If there is multiple styles(confilicting) for same id/class/elements, it will take the last one

But inline style always will be priority, if we use inline styles.

CSS BOX Model

-> content can be anything
-> border (A line around the element, still inside of the element)
-> padding (Invisible space around the content, still inside of the element)
-> Margin (Space outside of the element, between elemnets in the document)
-> Fill area (Area that gets filled with background color or background image)

final element width = left border + left padding + width(content) + right padding + right border.

final element height = top border + top padding + height(content) + bottom padding + bottom border

padding shorthand - padding top bottom left right -> padding 40px 20px;

collapsing margin - whenever there is a confilict in the margin between two elemnets, the element with higher value takes 

to center the webpage, we need to put all the elements in the center

so create a container for the all the elments and set width to some value and then add margin-left and margin-right to auto.

it will make the page center. 

for inline elements, paddings and margins are applied only horizontally(left and right)

display: block,inline-block,inline (Refer the slides)

Positions

Normal Flow - defualt:relative
>Default Positioning
>Element is "in flow"
>Elements are simply laid out according to their order in the HTML code.

Absolute

Element is removed from normal flow, Out of flow

No impact on surronding elements, might overlap them

we use top,bottom,left or right to offset the element from its relatively positioned container

postion: absolute;

by defualt it will be positioned according to the viewport.
